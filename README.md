RESTful API using NodeJS and ExpressJS

- I have used Node.js, a simple and powerful tool for backend development and combined it with express to create lightweight, fast, scalable APIs quickly and simply.

- Here, I have designed a lightweight Express server serving truly RESTful services using Node.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB

- I have also implemented all of the RESTful verbs: Get, Put, Patch, Post and Delete data from service

- I have also spent some time working through unit and end to end integration tests for the services using Mocha and Supertest

- Have added few Gulp tasks for automation
